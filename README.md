# Trip Planner

Hello, this project consists in having an organized schedule of a trip you are planning to undertake. It allows you to filter the contents by type and was created to showcase some of the main functionalities of React.

Scss is used as a style preprocessor.

## Installing the project

Run `npm install` in your Terminal to install all the required dependecies.

## Running the project

Run `npm start` in your Terminal. Visit [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) to access the project interface.

## Using Trip Planner

Trip Planner has been created with the purpose of helping you keeping track of your movements when undertaking a trip.
The App can be used with different types of journey by modifying the `travel_data.json` file with your own details that will be then filtered and categorised by the App.
By using the filter tool you will be able to see what kind of trasport/ accomodation you are planning to use on each day of your trip - in addition to the events you are planning to partecipate to - without loosing track of many different scheduled departures.
Have fun!
