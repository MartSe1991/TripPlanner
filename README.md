## Using Trip Planner

Trip Planner has been created with the purpose of helping you keeping track of your movements when undertaking a trip.
The App can be used with different types of entries by modifying the `src/assets/travel_data.json` file with your own details that will be then filtered and categorised by the App.
By using the filter tool you will be able to see what kind of trasport/ accomodation you are planning to use on each day of your trip - in addition to the events you are planning to partecipate to - without loosing track of many different scheduled departures.
Have fun!
